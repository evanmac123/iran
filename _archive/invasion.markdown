Iran or Persia as it was formerly known was neutral in World War I but was the center of Russia and Great Britain's Great Game for control over the middle east. The German's entered into this game in the beginning of the 20 Century to eventual cut off India from the British. At the start of World War I the Central Powers led by the Ottoman Empire would begin skirmishes on the edges of Persian territories. The Russians and British shortly after invaded Persia to protect their oil and established their respective spheres of influence in the North and the South. The war ended with Persia under foreign occupation and without much hope.
