Originally set up by Burmah Oil in 1909 the company would buy D'Arcy's concession and begin to set up what was the the largest Refinery in the world for the next fifty years. In the aftermath of World War II the British government would buy a majority of shares in the company and operate it as a proxy to help fuel their ships. The company was renamed in 1954 to its modern name as British Petroleum or BP.
