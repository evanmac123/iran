Reza Shah in the 1920’s began to pressure for fundamental changes in the terms of the original 1908 oil concession. This arrangement pulled back the original concession area to 100,000 square miles, exempted the company from all taxes other than those provided for in the original concession and, most importantly, extended the concession for another 60 years. The Iranians gained 25 percent of the company’s shares an increase from their original 16 percent the new agreement that took effect in 1933.
