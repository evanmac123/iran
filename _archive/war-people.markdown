Iran's military forces could not stand up to attacks from the Russians, Germans, Ottomans, and British. The military had little artillery and was mostly reliant on rifles and horses. Defenses crumbled quickly and the government was overthrown and run as a puppet system by foreign powers. The war ended with Persia under foreign occupation and without much hope as the British formally considered annexing them as a protectorate.
