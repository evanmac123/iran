A drilling team under George B. Reynolds was sent to Persia and began to search for oil for the millionaire William D’Arcy. In 1903 a company was formed and D'Arcy had to spend over £500,000 to cover the costs. False hopes were raised in 1904 and D'Arcy was forced to find further financial support, with the Burmah Oil Company Ltd. agreeing to put up to £100,000 into the venture in return for much of the stock. Drilling began at one site in January 1908 and at another nearby in March. By April with no success the venture was close to collapse and D'Arcy almost bankrupt, but on 16 May there were encouraging signs and on 26 May at 1,180 feet (360 m) they struck oil.
