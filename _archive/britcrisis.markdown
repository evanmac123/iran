In 1943 Iran declared war on Germany due to pressure from Allied forces and by doing so gained membership in the United Nations. The dominance of Allied forces on Iran’s social and economics systems would harshly disrupt the economic and political growth the country had enjoyed before the war. This domination and the lack of respect for Iranian power and autonomy would be most expressed in the 1943 Tehran conference where the “Big Three” leader of the U.S., U.S.S.R. and Great Britain would be meet to go over military and diplomatic decisions. Though this conference was held in Iran, a now legitimate ally, the Allied Powers would shut the proceedings to all Iranian diplomats and dictate the future end of the occupation through vague promises of commitment to Iranian independence and future economic aid.
