quote-content: It is certain that movements of conquest by Germany will continue and will extend beyond Europe to Asia, Africa, and even to the Americas, unless they are stopped by military force. It is equally certain that those countries which desire to maintain their independence must engage in a great common effort if they are not to be engulfed one by one as has already happened to a large number of countries in Europe.

On August 17th 1941 Allied Powers invaded Iran to secure the vital oil fields for the Allied war machine and to oust the German leaning dictator Reza Shah. Iran was neutral in the war but the Allies felt that the loss of the British oil fields and strategic flank of Russia were more valuable than Iranian independence. 

After a surprise attack from combined British and Russian forces the overwhelmed forces Iranian forces would surrender on August 29th eleven days after the invasion started. As the Russians entered Tehran on September 16th 1941 Reza Shah would abdicate the throne due to his disagreements with the Allied governments and was sent to South Africa in exile. His son Reza Pahlavi would take the throne and would be a puppet ruler of Iran while the majority of the country would be under the direct control the British and Russian military.
