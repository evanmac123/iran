quote-content: "If it be asked why we should undertake the task at all, and why Persia should not be left to herself and allowed to rot into picturesque decay, the answer is that her geographical position, the magnitude of our interests in the country, and the future safety of our Eastern Europe render impossible for us now - just as it would have been impossible for us any time during the last fifty years - to disinherit ourselves from what happens in Persia"

From 1914 to 1919 Iran was mired in chaos created from the World War I. Britain would realize the value of the oil under the sands of Iran and would invade Iran to safe guard their resources from the Axis powers. The War and subsequent Russian Revolution would make Iran a battleground as British and Soviet Union troops would fight over the political dominance of the country. Under these circumstances Iran would become a puppet of the British and Russians through military intervention, martial law, and economic bullying.
