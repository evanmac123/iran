quote-content: "Our younger intellectuals cannot possibly understand, and thus cannot possibly judge Reza Shah. They cannot because they were too young to remember the chaotic and desperate conditions out of which he arose."

With discontent against the Qajar monarchy after the chaos of the World War I, a colonel with British support overthrew the monarchy. Reza Khan would become prime minister and use his political talent, military support, and British backing to abolish the Qajar monarchy. He pushed the Soviets from northern Iran and establish the Pahlavi Dynasty under his firm rule. Over the 1930’s Reza Shah ruled with an iron fist and began to remove power from foreign governments. In the next ten years Reza Shah would modernize and westernize Iran through brutal but effective crack downs on democracy, communist groups, and Islamic traditionalists.
