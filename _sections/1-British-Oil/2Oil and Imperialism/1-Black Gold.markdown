 Iran’s Qajar monarchy between 1850-1930 sold away the majority of the countries resources and trade to support the lavish lifestyle of the royal family. The most crippling of these sales was the 1901 sale of a 60-year petroleum search concession to the famous billionaire William Knox D’Arcy of British Petroleum. What both D’Arcy and the Qajar monarchy didn’t know is that Iran was strategically placed on a few of the world’s largest oil deposits of around 150 billion barrels only a few miles beneath the sand.
