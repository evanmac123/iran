Iran is one of the world’s oldest nations with roots in thousands of years of art, history, empire, and beauty. Known for the majority of its existence as Persia, names such as Cyprus, Darius, would shake the world with mighty armies and glorious empires of wealth and prosperity. Only the last century or so has seen the fate of Iran change into a tragedy. Over time the empire would fall to corruption and turmoil as the nation fell to the rising tides of religion, gluttony, and foreign invasion and speculation.
